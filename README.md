# GravenGPT
> ask anything to Graven, he will give you answer, if he can..

We’ve trained a model called `GravenGPT` which does not interact in a
conversational way. The dialogue format makes it not possible for
`GravenGPT` to answer followup questions, 
admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, 
and reject inappropriate requests.

As its acronym indicates, Generative Pre-training Transformer,
`GravenGPT` is a generative language model based on the ‘transformer’
architecture. These models are capable of processing large
amounts of text and learning to perform natural language processing
tasks very effectively. The `GravenGPT model`, in particular,
It has no single parameter, making it `the most useless language model ever trained`.

Welcome to the new world.
